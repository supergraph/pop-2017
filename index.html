					<h2>A <strong>Symposium</strong>, accompanied with a <strong>temporary library, </strong> 
					<br /><strong>workshops</strong> and performances.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left">
Our current social order is surely reaching a critical period of its time. With the rise of ethno-national parties and fragmentation of European Union, authoritarianism feed on xenophobia generated by 'terrorism'. 
Dazzled by the hyperreality of overloading information and sensation from media channels, we find ourselves questioning the future of borderless and multi-cultural landscape of Europe. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
Is cultural diversity deteriorating or is it a transition of new order? Or is such turbulent time catalysis of artistic and cultural resistance? What does activism mean in such context? Is it a event, a desire, or emotion?
Our future is heading toward the unknown. Can we find the possible new vision, structure, model and tool through the act of art?
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
Supported by Interface Cultures Lab, artists, hackers, cultural producers, educators and students, Poetics of Politics (PoP) is an one day boot camp in artivism. 
The aim is to interweave the euro-political discourse with multiplex roles, formats and disciplines in terms of art, activism and technology. The program includes symposium, temporary library as research space, workshop and social gathering.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
The symposium is composed of practitioners and theorists from a diverse background and insights in arts and politics, imagining clarity, narrative and strategy for the possible future. The library serves as a hub for ideologies while passionate manifestations evolved into workshop and performance.

<p>
Nowadays, information appears to be easily accessible. However, due to a comprehensive amount of sources and the growing privatization over it’s access, the quality and reliability of many of them is unclear, opening the door for propaganda and ideologies.
</p><p>
The Reading Room is an experimental utopia-place, where a public temporary space for sharing viewpoints and interpretations is created. It’s a curatorship of books, zines and independent publishing all serving as content and inspiration for performative utterances, manifestos and non-hierarchical generation of knowledge.
</p><p>
From discourse to dialogue, from digital to analogue, from reading to copying and self editing; the actions which permeate this dynamic library are all an effort to bring authorship, interaction, performativity out of the screens and into the physical materiality of daily life. Here the notion of time is other: past, present and future coexist in a place; at the same time repository of memory, data, actions and projects to the future. The Reading Room’s aim is to provide space to promote, connect and improve the dialogue between individuals and society, mediated  through printed texts, an interactive survey, and a copy machine as instruments of memory and of democratisation of knowledge.

									<p><strong>Plans in the Sand</strong></p>
                                    <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 0.9em;">
                                    A Utopic Exploration of Today using the backroom tools of the shamans to talk about Tomorrow.<br />
                                    Utopia means to critique the present and to propose something other for the future. As artists we can do this with images, and also with words.
                                    During this workshop we will prepare a sketch and a text for the sand, to describe some aspect of today that we wish were different, specifically regarding methodologies of mass communication. 
                                    At the end we will perform the two together, breathing life into them with hands and fingers, a series of open un-open sketches.

									<p><strong>2057: Speculative Climate Fiction</strong></p>
                                    <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 0.9em;">
                                    Climate change has reached our backyards, and while scientists present us the facts, writers and artists are increasingly contributing to the debate by translating graphs and numbers into fictional stories, speculating about how our world might change.<br />
                                    In this workshop, we will invite the participants to collaboratively imagine their own climate fiction by using the methodology of conditional design. The group's dynamic will lead the way to unfold shared scenarios.

                                    <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 0.9em;">
                                    The wireless devices grow in its usage as fast as digital natives born, the communication is being delocalized by terms of the moving nodes of the network, and the information relays every day more in the content uploaded by users. This process is not left unattended by the socio-politic movements which find in this technologies a perfect ally in self-organizing, uncensored communication and coordination in real time along the physical space.<br />
                                    In this workshop we will visit some of the most critical experiences and the technical methods behind those that can be potentially useful to hack and create distributed and autonomous networks.
